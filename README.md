# Complexity72h 2025 - Busy Bees 🐝

> Hastily uploaded code!

Builds and plots temporal graphs for ecological networksand computes possible correlations with observed environmental factors: NMI, bidirectedness (positive and negative links), graph entropy and centralization...

**Only null hypotheses confirmed → no clear correlation (or not enough data) among different factors!**
